However, I can guide you on how to query your PostgreSQL database to show all tables. You can use the following SQL command:  ```sql SELECT table_name  FROM information_schema.tables  WHERE table_schema = 'public'; ```  This query retrieves all table names from the public schema of your PostgreSQL database. If you're using a different schema, you might need to adjust the `table_schema` condition accordingly."}. USERNAME: admin
