# Neura Query API â€“ Backend

A FastAPI-based backend that powers Neura Query, translating natural language into SQL, executing queries, and returning results from user databases.

---

## Important note!

This repo is synced with the [neura-query-frontend](https://github.com/Rephael4321/neura-query) repo.
You can set it up, and setup the fronted for a nice GUI. If you are encountering a problem with the setup or with the usage of this project, please let me know with a pull request.

## Overview

Neura Query enables users to query SQL databases using natural language. This backend serves as the core API that handles:

- User authentication (sign in / sign up)
- Translating natural language queries into SQL
- Executing SQL queries against the user's connected database
- Returning clean, structured results to the frontend

Built with **FastAPI** and running via **Uvicorn**, this backend is the engine behind the Neura Query frontend interface.

---

## System Architecture

The Neura Query API functions as the backend gateway for all user interactions.

- Receives API requests from the frontend
- Handles authentication and validation
- Sends natural language queries to the **Server Manager** over a **Kafka** (Kraft) messaging system
- The **Server Manager** performs the AI-driven translation and query logic
- Communicates with a **PostgreSQL** database
- Returns query results to the frontend in a structured format

## Project Structure

This structure is concise, and display only the most important partial structure of the project.

- docker-compose.yaml # Config file for docker-compose
- initialize_db.py # Specialized script for initializing Neura Query DB. Used only once at startup. WARNING: It erases all data!
- fastapi/ # Docker container used as the API.
- manager/ # Docker container used as the Server Manager.
- shared/ # Those are files that are crucial for both, fastapi and manager. Those files has to be synced in both services.
